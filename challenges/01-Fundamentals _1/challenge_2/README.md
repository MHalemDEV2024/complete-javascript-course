# CHALLENGE #2
Use the BMI example from `Challenge #1`, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

- Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

  `"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!"` or \
  `"John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"`.

-  Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs. \
**Example:** \
`Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!` or \
 `John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!`.

**Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.**



**IMPORTANT:** The `**` operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula `mass / (height * height)`, and not this one `mass / (height ** 2)`.
